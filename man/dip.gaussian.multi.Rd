dip.gaussian.multi(
  coor_atoms = "",
  center_of_mass = F,

  subunits_inputs_vector = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{coor_atoms}{3 or 4 atoms character (e.g. '1 2 3')}

\item{center_of_mass}{logical, should use center of mass of the
basic structure as origin or not, if TRUE - center_of_mass_substructure
must be FALSE}

\item{center_of_mass_substructure}{logical, should use center of mass of
a substructure as origin or not, if TRUE - center_of_mass must be FALSE}

\item{subunits_inputs_vector}{ONLY if center_of_mass_substructure is TRUE - vector of
atoms character (e.g. c('10 11 12 13', '4 5 6 7 8 9'))}
}
\value{
data frame with multiple or single DMs
