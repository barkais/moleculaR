\title{Create a Formatted Table of Out-of-Sample Validation Results}
\usage{
oos_validation_table(
  oos_data,
  plot.title = "Out-of-Sample Validation",
  subtitle = "Predicted vs Measured Values",
  conformation = "",
  error_threshold = 20
)
}
\arguments{
\item{oos_data}{A data frame containing out-of-sample validation results with the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item \code{OOS Pred} - Predicted values for out-of-sample data
  \item \code{OOS Measured} - Actual measured values for out-of-sample data
  \item \code{OOS Error} - Difference between measured and predicted values
}}

\item{plot.title}{Title for the plot (default: "Out-of-Sample Validation")}

\item{subtitle}{Subtitle for the plot (default: "Predicted vs Measured Values")}

\item{conformation}{Optional text to indicate conformational information, added to the caption (default: "")}

\item{error_threshold}{Numeric threshold for acceptable prediction error (default: 20). Errors with 
absolute values below or equal to this threshold are marked as acceptable.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object representing a formatted table with the following features:
        \itemize{
          \item Row names from the input data frame as compound identifiers
          \item Columns for predicted values, experimental values, and errors
          \item Color-coded errors (green for acceptable, red for unacceptable)
          \item Summary statistics in the caption (MAE and percentage of predictions within threshold)
        }
}
\description{
This function generates a formatted ggplot visualization of out-of-sample prediction results,
presenting the predicted values, measured values, and errors in a tabular format. The table 
includes color-coded error indicators to highlight which predictions meet an acceptable error threshold.
}
\details{
The function creates a custom ggplot visualization that mimics a table layout with grid lines.
Row heights are equal, and the table is designed with a fixed aspect ratio for consistent display.
Errors are color-coded based on the specified threshold to provide a quick visual assessment
of prediction quality.

The table includes a caption with summary statistics:
\itemize{
  \item Mean Absolute Error (MAE) across all predictions
  \item Percentage of predictions that fall within the acceptable error threshold
  \item Optional conformational information if provided
}
}
