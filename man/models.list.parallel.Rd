\title{Generate Linear Models from Feature Subset Selection with Parallel Processing}
\usage{
models.list.parallel(
  dataset,
  min = 2,
  max = NULL,
  leave.out = "",
  folds = nrow(read.csv(dataset)),
  iterations = 1,
  cutoff = 0.5,
  cor.threshold = 1,
  min_models = 50,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Path to a CSV file containing the data. First column should contain row identifiers,
and the last column should contain the outcome variable.}

\item{min}{Minimum number of features to include in a subset (default: 2).}

\item{max}{Maximum number of features to include in a subset (default: NULL, which automatically
sets the value to min(floor(nrow(data)/5), 5)).}

\item{leave.out}{Vector of row identifiers to exclude from model training. These samples
will be used for external validation if specified (default: '').}

\item{folds}{Number of folds for cross-validation (default: number of rows in the dataset).}

\item{iterations}{Number of iterations for cross-validation (default: 1).}

\item{cutoff}{Initial R-squared cutoff for model selection (default: 0.50). The function adaptively
adjusts this value if too few models meet the initial threshold.}

\item{cor.threshold}{Pearson correlation threshold for feature selection (default: 1.0). Variable pairs
with absolute correlation exceeding this value will not appear together in the same model.}

\item{min_models}{Minimum number of models to retain for cross-validation (default: 50). The function
adaptively adjusts the cutoff to ensure at least this many models are evaluated.}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether to print progress information (default: TRUE).}
}
\value{
A data frame with the best models (up to 15), ranked by cross-validated Q-squared value.
        The data frame contains columns for each model's formula, R-squared, Q-squared, MAE, and
        a Model number. The results are also saved to a CSV file in a timestamped directory.
}
\description{
This function performs feature subset selection to identify optimal linear models and saves
the results to a timestamped directory. It handles data preprocessing, cross-validation,
and optional prediction on left-out samples.
}
\details{
The function works in several stages:
1. It creates a timestamped directory for storing results
2. It reads and preprocesses the dataset, including scaling predictors
3. It separates any leave-out samples for later prediction
4. It runs model.subset.parallel to identify optimal models
5. It saves the results to a CSV file in the timestamped directory
6. If leave-out samples were provided, it makes predictions using the best model
   and saves these to a separate CSV file

The function handles error conditions gracefully and provides detailed progress information
when verbose=TRUE. It automatically determines appropriate parameter values when not explicitly
provided, making it suitable for both exploratory analysis and automated workflows.
